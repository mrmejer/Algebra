# Algebra
## Library
* Class BigNum: stores arbitrary size integers. BigNum supports all basic operators.
* Class BarretReducer: once initialized with a BigNum N, reduces any x modulo N
Implemented with a primary focus on efficiency.
## Algorithms
* Primality testing (Miller-Rabin Test)
* Integer factorization (Pollard's rho algorithm)
